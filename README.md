## organization

classes are generally grouped into "packages" (java carryover) by the scene which they are most prominently attached to. Any reuse will be factored into its own package.

Within each folder:
- `ui` represents UI objects.
- `game` represents game objects.
- `mat` represents classes associated with custom materials, or other rendering. Their corresponding resource files are located in `/resources`.
